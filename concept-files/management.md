TODO M 800.0 Purge unnecessary files to avoid confusing users when it goes public. Keep non-widget code somewhere safe.\
~~TODO M 800.1 readme.md or usage.md to include link to demo repo~~\
TODO G 810 Write a how-to-widget.md\
TODO M 820 Decide how to create a neat curved-text master branch. Options:

* Clean out curved-text 'master'. Pull request from widget into master. Fork a new repo for development. Make the latter private. Delete curved-text widget branch (which will probably delete all commits).

* Rename curved-text to curved-text-dev. Fork it into new repo: 'curved-text'. Delete concept-files from curved-text. Make curved-text-dev private. (This would let us keep commits, but not have them public.)

TODO M 830 Create a neat curved-text master branch (options above).\
TODO M 840 Make demo a fork of curved-text (not worth the effort?)\
TODO M 850 Approach others to try it and provide feedback?

 Go public:
 -
TODO M 880 Delete 'under construction' from readme.md\
TODO M 890 'Donate' button.\
TODO M 900 Ask Fitbit to put it in OSS apps.\
TODO M 910 Integrate with Sergio's "Fitbit Widgets"
